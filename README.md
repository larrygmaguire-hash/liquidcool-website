## Notes for Client

1. **Links are placeholders** - clicking navigation items or buttons won't navigate anywhere
2. **Product/use case images** are placeholder boxes - would be replaced with actual product photography
3. **Testimonial quote** is sample text - would be replaced with real client testimonial
4. **Partner logos** are text placeholders - would be replaced with actual logo images
5. **Country count** in statistics shows "20+" as placeholder

## Next Steps (if client approves)

1. Gather actual product photography
2. Obtain partner logo files and usage permissions
3. Collect real testimonials/case studies
4. Finalise copy for all sections
5. Build out additional pages (Products, Technology, Solutions, etc.)
6. Set up contact form functionality
7. Configure custom domain (e.g., liquidcool.ie)
